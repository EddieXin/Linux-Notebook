__Update 13-05-2017__:   __It's an Ubuntu-Notebook written by myself, for the daily summary of Ubuntu using.__

## Introduction

I'm used to recording my summary of daily Ubuntu using. My operating system is [Ubuntu 14.04.5](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04.5/), a classic and Long Term Support (LTS) version of Linux.

And this Linux-Notebook will still be improved and be updated.

## Usage 

* Haha, you know it.

## Requirements

   * No specific requirements
